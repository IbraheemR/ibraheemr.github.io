<h1>Hi! I'm Ibraheem Rodrigues, aka OBAN</h1>

<p>Based in London, I've been intrigued by coding, making and electronics ever since my first experiences with a Raspberry Pi
  at age 9, I've . I mainly work in Python, but also use JavaScript quite a bit. I've also done some work in Godot and Django.
  I've built this website with Jekyll to document the projects I've been working on.
