title: DofE Skills -  Blender Gallery
---

This work was done in 2019/2020 for my DofE Gold Award Skills Section. I've been using blender for a while, but wanted to really dive into the software. I commited to spending a few hours every other week creating a new render, completing a tutorial or exploring a new part of the software.

This pushed my skills massively in terms of overall familiarity - particularly I made lots of progress with the "Animation Nodes" addon, which allows for programatic control of animation and objects in the scene.

## Week 1 - Procedural Landscape Generation (Cycles)

The first image is my rendition of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrMee2gcS20) tutorial. I wasn't satisfied with my texturing, so I adapted the same technique with my own shader to create the low-poly Mars-like render on the right. Complete with martian birds! I've done some similar tests using Animation Nodes to warp a mesh, which I think would be more efficient, however, it's been hard to get the same easing in the height.

## Week 2 - Seamless particle loop with Animation Nodes (EEVEE)

This was my attempt to create a seamless particle loop using the mighty
Animation Nodes (best plugin!). No matter what I did I was unable to avoid a
small bit of stuttering at the looping point, but overall I'm pleased with the
result.

## Week 3 - The DMate Device (EEVEE) A modeling and materials study

based on the aesthetic of camera lenses and watches. ![](week3.jpeg)

## Week 4 -Procedural Stary Sky Wallpaper (EEVEE)

Procedural textures are super cool. A few minutes building a shader and BAM, infinite variation, infinite tiling, and no repetition. To challenge my skills I made this stary sky wallpaper.

I've been finding I'm overestimating my abilities and getting caught up, so for
the next few weeks I'm going to stick to following tutorials. This one was based
on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGRhJf0xdE8) tutorial by BlenderGuru.

## Week 6 - Realistic Rain (Cycles)

This is probably by best render yet, and a fun one too. Based off of [this
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35bbyAJodEQ).

## Week 7 - Assorted Jars (Cycles)

A few jars I had fun creating. Based off of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGKTk5wPIZM).

## Week 8 - Clay Shader

A clay shader I tested making, complete with procedural fingerprints. Based off of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTu3Xssw67Q).

## Week 11 - Low Mountain (Cycles) ![](week11.png) I've been following the work

of [Roman Klƒço](https://romanklco.com/) on his YouTube channel Polygon Runway
for a while now, and I wanted to have a go at emulating his style. This comes
nowhere near to the level of detail he puts in, but I'm happy with the final
result.

## Week 12 & 13 - Halley VI Modeling (WIP)

I've embarked on a project to model the [Halley VI Antarctic](https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/) research station in Blender. This will likely take me a few weeks, so here is a WIP screenshot for the last two weeks showing my progress.

## Week 14 - Toroidal Annihilation

I'm taking a break from Halley VI, and doing a smaller test.
