## [Video](https://youtu.be/orQejn3VCsE ) out now

This project was an absolute blast, and although fustrating at times the outcome is excellent - though not without heaps of room for improvement.

All parts were made from a 0.4mm sheet of brass. It's easily cut, hammered, soldered, anealed and to round it off can polished to an incredible golden shine; a truely beautiful material both to work with and to look at.

The rim was bent into shape and soldered in place, aided along by a powerful flux and a pair of medical forceps. As beautiful as the filets of solder seen in this photo are, they were eventually lost after many repeated reheatings to attach hinge and clasp. The wet rag trick I show in the video helped greatly in getting there.

After many attempts these hand cut hinges turned out beautifully, though I did have some trouble where one ripped from its rim (the fact that I was able to resolder it with some patience is a testament to the amazing qualities of brass). It is also interesting to note the copper like colour the metal takes after heating - I speculate this is the zinc at the surface of the metal vaporising out of its alloy, leaving a thin layer for copper in ins place.

Hinge tutorial coming soon! (maybe.)

Finally with an after noon of filing, to open up the holes in the rims and some polishing, it is done! I think the photo speaks for itself.
