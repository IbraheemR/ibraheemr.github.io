I'm doing a deep dive into Blender 2.8 as part of my DofE Gold award by doing a render each week. See the results here!

### Week 1 - Procedural Landscape Generatoion

The first image is my rendition of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrMee2gcS20) tutorial. I was unsatisfied with my texturing, so I adapted the same technique with my own shader to create the low-poly Mars-like render on the right. Complete with martian birds!

### Week 2 - Seamless particle loop with Animation Nodes

Excusing the low quality of the gif, this was my attempt to create a seamless particle loop using the mighty Animation Nodes (best plugin!). No matter what I did I was unable to avoid a small bit of stuttering at the looping point, but overall I'm pleased with the result.

### Week 3 - The DMate Device.
