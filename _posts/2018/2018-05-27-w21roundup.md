This week saw the end of the first summer half term at school, I have have a whole week to work on projects!

Often I've found often I get bored quickly in holidays, all the tasks I have to do become a drag, but this week I'm pupmed to do some work on the OBAN's IO (OIO) mod ([Repo](https://github.com/IbraheemR/oban_io)), start learning AngularJS and maybe even get round to finishing v1.1 of PAKit. We'll see how long that lasts. This website is still under work, hopefully I'll finish it sometime soon as well.

Now I think of it, loads has happened this week, here are some highlights:

- BEM7 emails are now up and running! [director@bem7.tk](mailto:director@bem7.tk) is now a thing, send me an email.
- I've finished setting up an experient in school, testing the growth of a bacteria in vaious sucrose solutions. I'm trying to replicate the growth of cellulose sheets, as done by [The Thought Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds8ZFzOwGeI). I'll have a blog post comming shortly.
- The RodSinski Electric Go Kart Project is now very much underway, I'm in the midst of processing cells. Have a look at the presentation [here](https://kart.bem7.tk). We're releasing it under BEM7 Electric as we have another related project to come in about a year or two. BEM7 has certainly got some (over) ambitious [minds](https://twitter.com/KouroshSimpkins).
